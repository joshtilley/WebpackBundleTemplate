Github Pages Link: https://joshtilley.github.io/Restaurant-Website/

Mock website created to practice webpack. 

Each page of the website is contained within its own module. 

When the site first loads, the home page is rendered dynamically. 

When a tab button in the nav-bar is clicked for the first time, the elements associated with that page link are rendered dynamically and the previous page transitions into the newly selected one. 
On subsequent clicks, the elements are only transitioned in or out.
